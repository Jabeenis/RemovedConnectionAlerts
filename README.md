# RemovedConnectionAlerts

Keep track of your friends and servers on [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/RemovedConnectionAlerts), and get notified if you get unfriended or kicked from a server.

Note: This plugin only tracks removals from when it's installed. It cannot show you your history from before installation.

When you use this plugin, it's a good idea to regularly keep backups of your history files in case something happens to it. Backups can be done directly from the plugin UI. Please make them now and then.

Your history files themselves can be found next to the plugin file. They are named `RemovedConnectionAlerts_{your Discord user ID number here}.config.json`.

## Credits

Inspired by [Metalloriff](https://github.com/Metalloriff) and their [GuildAndFriendRemovalAlerts](https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/GuildAndFriendRemovalAlerts). Code written in this project is independent and unrelated. Mostly a passion project and coding exercise.

Thank you [programmer2514](https://github.com/programmer2514) and their [CollapsibleUI](https://github.com/programmer2514/BetterDiscord-CollapsibleUI) for helping me out with UI things as well!
